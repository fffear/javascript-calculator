Javascript Calculator Project from ["The Odin Project"](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/calculator)

This project is to make a completely functional calculator using javascript. [View Here](https://fffear.github.io/javascript-calculator/)

In order to build the calculator, I used a combination of html, css and javascript.

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Completely functional basic calculator</li>
  <li>Intuitive Design</li>
  <li>Intuitive Keyboard support</li>
  <li>Error message when trying to divide by zero</li>
  <li>Disallows multiple operators to be entered consecutively</li>
  <li>Allows calculation of multiple operands</li>
  <li>Allows brackets to be used in calculations</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lessons learned</h3>

This project allowed me to implement javascript basics. There was a strong focus on string manipulation to handle the numbers for display and for calculation, and adding event listeners since the calculator required human input.

There were 2 main issues which consumed alot of my time. The first one being bugs kept on popping up, and having to go back and debug code took a significant amount of time.

However, the most time consuming aspect of this project was implementing a "Shunting Yard Algorithm" to convert the original infix expression entered by a human to postfix expression for computer calculation.

The first challenge was that I had to figure out what a shunting yard algorithm was. This was fairly straightforward, and took about a day to fully grasp the concept.

Implementing a creating it however was a much more difficult task, and took me about a week.

In doing so however, I learnt a great deal about string to number conversion, and vice versa, as well as implementing objects and arrays for data storage and usage.
